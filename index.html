      <h2>Let's go Celtics</h2>
      <p>It's a common phrase you here all the time when the Boston Celtics play, and it's timing is usually about when the team's looking to make a run.</p>
      <h2>Let's go Celtics</h2>
      <p>But on Thursday, with a couple minutes or so to play and the C's down by about 20 points, the chants started.</p>
      <a href="#" class="link-medium">Let's go Celtics</a>
      <h2>Let's go Celtics</h2>
      <p>And they kept going and going and going. The disappointment that the C's players felt in losing 98-79 to the Miami Heat goes without saying. But the way the fans reacted even when the game was out of reach, clearly struck a chord with the players as well as C's coach Doc Rivers.</p>
